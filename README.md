# Signals & Sorcery

`Signals & Sorcery` is an experimental RPG powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  It has a touch / natural language hybrid UI. A user chooses an art style and describes a fantasy setting then a map and game assets will be generated accordingly.  From there a player can navigate the map collecting, artifacts, weapons, clues and combating encounter along the way.

Play the hosted version here:

# Signals & Sorcery infrastructure (DockerCompose)

This repo is all the code needed to support the REACT UI client.  The repo contains the following services:

* **Signals & Sorcery API SERVER:** The Django server (DRF) which serves the API and handles uploads/downloads to cloud storage.
* **Signals & Sorcery AUTH SERVER:** A Django server which handles user registration and authentication.
* **POSTGRES DATABASE:** A database which stores all the data for the Signals & Sorcery infrastructure

Find the REACT UI client here:

## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ON MAC

1) check that python is installed, and you are running >= python 3.10

```bash
python --version
``` 

If the default version is less than 3.10 update it before proceeding

2) Install docker desktop:

```bash
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

3) install postgres (on your local mac)
 
Using brew is one of many options:

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

4) In the root of the repo, rename `.example-env` to `.env`

```bash 
mv .example-env .env
```

5) UPDATE THE VALUES in the `.env`  file
 
NOTES: 
- Setup an smtp email relay.  `https://www.brevo.com/` is one of many options 
- Update the Postgres User/Pass before starting docker-compose 
- Files are pushed to GCP Storage.  Please signup for a GCP bucket and download the GCP Service account file.  You will need to add the path in your .env file

6) CREATE AN RUN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

```bash
cd signals-and-sorcery-server
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make setting=api migrations
```

*note: the migrations will be applied when you do the `docker compose up --build`*

6) RUN docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build 
```
NOTE: newer versions of docker use the command `docker compose up â€”build` with no hyphen

  
## Dependencies:

* **SERVER:** You will a server expose to the public internet.  I recommend a multi-core Ubuntu VM on AWS or GCP.
* **DOCKER-COMPOSE:** you will need docker and docker-compose installed on you server.  I recommend querying CHAT-GPT for instructions on how to install docker-compose on your server.
* **GCP CLOUD STORAGE:** As currently implemented the system expects to use GCP cloud storage for the storage and transfer of audio files.  You will need to create a GCP account, download the service account key, put it in the root of the repo, the filling the environment variables.  See `example.env` for the required format of the service key.


## Running The Services

Set up your environment variables by renaming the `example.env` to `.env` and fill in the required values.  

Start the services using docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
````

After running this command, (BY DEFAULT) you should have the following services exposed on the following ports:

* **Signals & Sorcery API SERVER:** `http://[YOUR-IP-AT-PORT]:8081`
* **Signals & Sorcery WEB SOCKET:** `http://[YOUR-IP-AT-PORT]:8765`
